Here, I share a step-by-step pdf document on how to create annual rasters of evapotranspiration, land surface temperature, and precipitation (available dates: 2003 to the most recent completed year).
The pdf document contains links to code in Google Earth Engine and a reference to the Python code shared in this repository.
